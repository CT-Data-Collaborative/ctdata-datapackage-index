# Index of CT Data Datapackages

## Introduction

Data publishing is at the core of what we do at CTData. The vast majority of our datasets are published to our custom [CKAN installation](http://data.ctdata.org). However, we also publish our datasets to GitHub as datapackages. This repository serves as the index for our datapackage repositories. Not all of our datasets are currently available as datapackages, but we will update this index as we convert and publish new datapackages. This index is structure to roughly conform to the topic structure we have used in our [Data by Topic](http://data.ctdata.org/data_by_topic) view. We are also including helper datapackages that we use as part of our publishing processes. Note: Not all datasets listed here are complete. We will update this index as we begin processing.
